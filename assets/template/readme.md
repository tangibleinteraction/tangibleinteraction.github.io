# üöÄ How to Create a Project Page

Welcome! This guide explains how to build your own project page for the site. Follow these steps to get started:

---

## üß© Step 1: Copy the Template Folder

- Go to `assets/template/`
- Copy the folder named `template_project` to the main project directory in `projects/.../<your-project>`.
- Rename the copied folder to match your project name (e.g. `interactive-sound`)

---

## üì∏ Step 2: Insert Your Images

- Add all your project images into the new folder
- Delete the default `echoes.jpg` image
- Make sure all filenames are **simple and lowercase** (e.g. `installation.jpg`)

---

## üñã Step 3: Edit the Template Metadata

At the top of the `index.md` file, update the front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: project
title: Echoes
authors: Some Name, Some Other
description: This is the teaser text that appears first on the project site and in the overview of the projects
teaser: echoes.jpg
images: 
  - image: Development process
    url: echoes.jpg
    space-above: 20
    space-below: 30
  - image: Target audience and approach
    url: echoes.jpg
  - image: Technology and models
    url: echoes.jpg
---

```

In the list of `images` you have to add an image caption (for the `alt` text). Below you need to reference one of your uploaded images by its name including the extension. Optionally, you can provide `space-above` and `space-below` to adjust the vertical position of the images next to the text on the right side.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Step 4: Customize the Content

Inside index.md, you can add your content using strict Markdown (or Kramdown) syntax:

```md
## Project Overview

This text appears on the right side of the project page. You can adjust the image positioning of the images on the left side (which is generated automatically from the list in the front matter above) by applying `space-above` and `space-below` to match this text.
```

Note that the author names and description text is automatically added as the first content, along with the teaser image.

## Finalize

You can now upload your project folder to the Github repository. Once you're done editing, your project will appear beautifully on the site with your chosen layout and content.
