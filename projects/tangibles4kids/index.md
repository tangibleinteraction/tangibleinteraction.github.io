In the summer term 2025, an interdisciplinary teaching format was implemented at the University of Applied Sciences Dresden, bringing together Masterâ€™s students from Design and Computer Science to explore how digital interaction can be made tangible. Focusing on Tangibles for Kids, the course aimed to design interactive systems that support playful learning and embodied exploration for young children. User studies were conducted in cooperation with a kindergarten in Dresden, providing direct insights into child-centered interaction design. Through project-based teamwork, students combined creative and technical approaches to develop physical-digital prototypes that respond to the cognitive and sensory needs of children. The results presented below illustrate the potential of collaborative learning between design and computer science in shaping future-oriented interaction concepts.
