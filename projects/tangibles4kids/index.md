In the summer term 2025, an interdisciplinary course at Dresden University of Applied Sciences brought together Master’s students from Design and Computer Science to explore tangible digital interaction. Focusing on »Tangibles for Kids,« the course tasked student teams with designing interactive systems  that support playful learning and embodied exploration for young children. In partnership with a Dresden kindergarten, user studies provided valuable, child-centered insights. Through collaborative, project-based work, the students developed physical-digital prototypes tailored to children’s cognitive and sensory needs. The results below illustrate the potential of collaborative learning between design and computer science in shaping future-oriented interaction concepts.
