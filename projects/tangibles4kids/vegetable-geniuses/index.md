## Project description

The "Vegetable Geniuses" project presents an interactive model bed that playfully conveys the principles of mixed cultivation. The bed consists of a wooden box with a laser-engraved surface on which moisture zones are visualized and a sun is depicted. Hand-crocheted vegetable models are used to illustrate different plant combinations in a practical and clear way.In addition to the models, lovingly designed information cards are included which explain the compatibility of the vegetable species with each other and describe their water and sun requirements. This promotes a holistic understanding of the plants' optimum growing conditions.The system supports learning through multi-sensory experience and enables complex ecological relationships to be grasped intuitively. "Vegetable Geniuses" is aimed at children (and interested adults) who want to learn about sustainable gardening practices and ecological plant care.

## Wood

Wood immediately evokes organic, agricultural associations, creating a direct connection to nature and gardening. Its warm, pleasant feel makes the bed inviting and promotes a positive sensory experience while learning.Thanks to its stability, wood is particularly robust and durable—it can withstand intensive use by children and is also suitable for outdoor use, for example as a mini raised bed in school and learning gardens. In addition, the design offers sufficient space to discreetly integrate technical components such as RFID readers.The laser-engraved surface clearly shows moisture zones and soil types in an abrasion-resistant manner without visually overloading the play area. Unlike colorful paint, the engraving highlights the water while still allowing the soil structure to be recognized.

## Process

At the beginning, a model was made from blue foam to understand the basic game system with modeling clay figures and to test the initial processes. A prototype was then created from plywood, which was produced using a laser cutter to ensure the correct proportions. However, this prototype proved to be unstable and did not meet the visual or technical requirements: the LED rings were still too visible and detracted from the design.The final model was then built as a sturdy wooden box made of high-quality wood. Recesses for the LED rings were specifically integrated, supplemented by diffuser plates that refract the light and ensure uniform, unobtrusive illumination. The surface was laser-engraved to permanently display moisture and sun zones in a clear, abrasion-resistant manner without obscuring the natural structure of the wood.

## Scientific approach and target group (context)

The project is aimed specifically at children in grades 1 and 2 and supports their natural curiosity and thirst for knowledge at this sensitive stage of development. In school and learning gardens, the interactive model offers an age-appropriate opportunity to discover and understand basic ecological relationships in a playful way.

By actively experimenting with the hand-crocheted vegetable models on the interactive garden bed, young learners are invited to independently test plant combinations and explore their compatibility. This action-oriented learning not only promotes cognitive understanding, but also strengthens problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and the joy of research.

A particular advantage of the model is that all experiments are carried out without the use of living plants. This creates a risk-free learning environment in which children can experiment without fear of “failure” or unintentionally damaging real plants. Mistakes are thus experienced as valuable learning opportunities, which strengthens the children's motivation and self-confidence.

The multisensory design of the project appeals to different learning types and supports the sustainable anchoring of knowledge. The combination of haptic models, visual representations, and informative cards creates a motivating learning environment that promotes independent research and the experience of self-efficacy.

## Fabric models

The vegetable models are deliberately not realistic or true to life, but rather abstract, symbolic representations of the respective vegetable types. This keeps them simple and clear, which is particularly important for children in grades 1 and 2.The soft, warm, and elastic feel of the crocheted models removes any fear of touching them and invites children to touch and play with them. They can be pressed or squeezed without damage, making them particularly robust and child-friendly. There is no risk of injury.

The handy sizes of the models are easy to grasp and handle—ideal for small children's hands.Instead of looking neutral or technical, the crocheted vegetables deliberately appear playful and people-friendly. They are reminiscent of familiar cuddly toys and thus create an emotional connection to the plant world.

In addition, the models are unique, lovingly handcrafted pieces – yet the principle can also be mass-produced to enable larger quantities.

## Technology

The interactive garden bed uses RFID technology to recognize the hand-crocheted vegetable models and determine their position on the bed. Each model contains a small RFID chip that is individually coded and
