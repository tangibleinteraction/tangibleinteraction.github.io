title: Veggi Genies
authors: Amelie Gruhn, Alexander Schulz
description: Veggi Genies is an interactive model bed using crocheted vegetable figures, info cards, and visual feedback to playfully teach mixed cultivation, water, and sun needs â€“ for children and curious adults.
details-1: The "Vegetable Geniuses" project presents an interactive model bed that playfully conveys the principles of mixed cultivation. The bed consists of a wooden box with a laser-engraved surface on which moisture zones are visualized and a sun is depicted. Hand-crocheted vegetable models are used to illustrate different plant combinations in a practical and clear way. In addition to the lovingly designed information cards, the system supports learning through multi-sensory experience and enables complex ecological relationships to be grasped intuitively.
details-2: At the beginning, a model was made from blue foam to understand the basic game system with modeling clay figures. A prototype was then created from plywood using a laser cutter. The final model was built as a sturdy wooden box with integrated LED rings and diffuser plates for uniform illumination. The surface was laser-engraved to permanently display moisture and sun zones without obscuring the natural structure of the wood.
details-3: The project is aimed specifically at children in grades 1 and 2 in school and learning gardens. By actively experimenting with the hand-crocheted vegetable models, young learners can independently test plant combinations without fear of "failure" or damaging real plants. The multisensory design appeals to different learning types and supports sustainable knowledge anchoring.
details-4: The vegetable models are abstract, symbolic representations with a soft, warm feel that invites children to touch and play. The interactive garden bed uses RFID technology to recognize the models and determine their position, creating a connection between physical play and digital feedback.

    <p>Wood immediately evokes organic, agricultural associations, creating a direct connection to nature and gardening. Its warm, pleasant feel makes the bed inviting and promotes a positive sensory experience while learning. The design offers sufficient space to discreetly integrate technical components such as RFID readers.</p>

    <p>This action-oriented learning not only promotes cognitive understanding but also strengthens problem-solving skills, critical thinking, and the joy of research. Mistakes are experienced as valuable learning opportunities, which strengthens the children's motivation and self-confidence.</p>

    <p>The crocheted models are handy, easily graspable, and reminiscent of familiar cuddly toys, creating an emotional connection to the plant world. Each model contains a small RFID chip that is individually coded to interact with the garden bed system.</p>
