## Project Description

This project introduces an interactive audio guide designed for children exploring the vibrant district of Dresden Neustadt. Equipped with a child-friendly wearable device featuring a GPS sensor, kids embark on a playful journey through the city. As they reach specific stations, the device triggers a sound signal, guiding them to stop and discover the next adventure.
At each location, children receive age-appropriate explanations about the place, enriched with fun interactive tasks that invite them to engage with their surroundings. The experience is part of the **Blickwinkel-Erlebnispfad**, highlighting memories of artists and important sites within the urban landscape.
Designed with flexibility in mind, this concept can be adapted to other cities, offering young explorers a unique and educational way to connect with their local culture and history.


## Realization

During the implementation phase, the team encountered technical issues with the GPS module, which proved to be unreliable for accurately triggering location-based audio playback. To ensure consistent functionality, the decision was made to switch to RFID technology. This alternative allowed for precise, location-specific interaction without dependency on satellite signals.

As a result, the final prototype successfully plays audio files at three stations along the **Blickwinkel-Erlebnispfad** in the Kunsthofpassage of Dresden Neustadt. Each station offers a unique auditory experience designed for children, combining storytelling with local art and cultural insights.

## Design Process

The design process began with adapting the housing to fit the electronic components. Since the GPS module and audio system had specific spatial requirements, the shape and size of the device had to be developed around the technology.

To explore form and ergonomics, an initial model was built using cardboard. This allowed for quick iteration and hands-on testing. Based on these insights, a more refined version was produced using 3D printing, enabling greater precision and a more realistic sense of the final product.

For the final prototype, alternative materials and a different scale were chosen to better suit the needs of children. This version prioritized durability, comfort, and usability while maintaining compatibility with the internal electronics.


## Feedback

The feedback from our peers provided valuable insights for refining the prototype. One key point concerned the symbolic role of the magnifying glass. It currently does not fully align with the interactive storytelling concept and could be rethought or better integrated into the narrative experience.

Another important aspect was the handle design, which needs to be optimized for smaller children’s hands to ensure comfortable and intuitive use. Ergonomics will play a central role in the next design iteration.

A frequently mentioned suggestion was to add a reward system, such as a treasure hunt, to increase motivation and engagement. This playful element could enhance the overall experience by encouraging exploration and adding a sense of achievement at each station.
Future development will focus on these improvements, aiming to make the device more accessible, engaging, and meaningful for young users.
