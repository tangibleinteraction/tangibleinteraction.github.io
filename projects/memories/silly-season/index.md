description: The interactive installation Sommerloch awakens the collective memory of a visit to the public pool. Lifting the fries triggers sound that, together with the design, evoke nostalgic memories of kiosk fries and carefree summer days.
details-1: Summer 2007. Your skin is sticky with sunscreen, your hair still wet. The scent of freshly cut grass mixes with the unmistakable smell of chlorine. In the distance, a whistle pierces the air, drowning out the rusty creak of the turnstile and the splashing from the pool. Your stomach starts to growl. And suddenly, you're craving the typical kiosk fries all over again.
details-2: What memories does it evoke?
  The public outdoor pool of childhood. From small towns and the countryside. A collective yet deeply personal memory shaped by the smells and sounds of chlorine, diving boards, cheerful commotion, lifeguards, and the ever-present kiosk selling fries, candy, and ice cream. All tied to the slow rhythm of summer holidays.

  This interactive installation takes the shape of a bowl of fries, just like the ones from the poolside kiosk. Three fries stick out and can be lifted. Each movement triggers a distinct sound, evoking shared memories of a day at the public pool, capturing the atmosphere and sensory experience of those timeless summer moments.
