## Background

Summer 2007. Your skin is sticky with sunscreen, your hair still wet. The scent of freshly cut grass mixes with the unmistakable smell of chlorine. In the distance, a whistle pierces the air, drowning out the rusty creak of the turnstile and the splashing from the pool. Your stomach starts to growl. And suddenly, you're craving the typical kiosk fries all over again.

## Purpose

What memories does it evoke? The public outdoor pool of childhood. From small towns and the countryside. A collective yet deeply personal memory shaped by the smells and sounds of chlorine, diving boards, cheerful commotion, lifeguards, and the ever-present kiosk selling fries, candy, and ice cream. All tied to the slow rhythm of summer holidays.

## Interaction Concept

This interactive installation takes the shape of a bowl of fries, just like the ones from the poolside kiosk. Three fries stick out and can be lifted. Each movement triggers a distinct sound, evoking shared memories of a day at the public pool, capturing the atmosphere and sensory experience of those timeless summer moments. As more fries are removed, multiple soundscapes begin to overlap, creating a layered auditory memory of summer: the rustling of trees, distant volleyball games, the sharp trill of a whistle, or the echo of underwater acoustics. Together, they form a sound collage of a day at the pool.

## Technical Implementation

- Hall sensors hidden in the tray detect the presence of magnets embedded in each fry.
- When a fry is removed, the change in the magnetic field triggers the playback of sound.
- Careful sensor placement is required, as the magnetic field of the loudspeakers could potentially interfere with the switches.

## Sound Elements

- Tree leaves rustling in the wind
